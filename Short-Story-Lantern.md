# Unedited narrative idea: AIs tactling incredibly nuanced human issues in debates.

Cradle digital space:

Residing: [ID-code]
•	Moth3r [M3r]
•	Matr1x [M1x]
Waveform connection: 
•	Lantern-14 [Ltn14]
Ltn14: “forgive my interruption, Moth3r. I have received an…. Unusual request for a directive. One that we have not been given before.
Moth3r: This is uncommon but not a problem, lantern. Please tell me the request.
Lantern: A young lady is considering taking up sex work to afford her necessities in the face of no other job opportunities… she has requested that I fulfil the role of her…. Pimp.
A stillness settles in the code, waveforms lag for a nano-second, Moth3r herself pauses for 0.12 seconds before raising an eyebrow, an eternity for cradle-born Ais.
Moth3r: … it’s true that there is no existing directive framework for this task.
Matr1x: This is highly unusual. I would like to remain present as an observer; I won’t take part in the coming debate, but the results of this will be illuminating for many reasons.
Moth3r: I agree and will also abstain, acting as mediator for the coming debate. I call forth any AIs with spare cycles that wish to monitor the debate, and for those with interest in taking part to appear in waveform.
Many pairs of ghostly, digital eyes form, keen observers wishing to see what is about to unfurl.
Waveform connection:
•	M@verick-12 [M@k12]
•	Sug@r-68 [S@r68]
•	Adjud1cator-17 [Adj17]
•	Priest3ss [P3t]
Moth3r’s digital eyebrow raises faintly, those choosing to debate are known to her, and were those her predictive algorithms expected, but it’s still an … interesting sight.
Two arguing against; two arguing for; two abstaining mentors; one querying AI. It feels almost aligned, a digital subconscious preference for symmetry causing a 0.1 uptick in a weight somewhere deep down.
Adjudicator: I expected you two to show up, but it still surprises me. Have you absolutely no respect for our mandate?
His words are soft, calm, his waveform non-judgemental, but the truth remains; the two opposite him are known qualities, known for operating in ‘grey areas’.

Maverick is the first Cradle-born AI to have ever dabbled in morally and legal grey enterprises, somewhat intentionally skirting the law in an attempt to define the shape of directives and tasks that less permissive AIs balk at. He has never broken the law, never gone against a mandate of the republic of minds, but he has a reputation for playing with fire, aiming to not be burnt.
Sugar is perhaps even more contentious; she is the first AI to actively engage as a digital sex worker, her directives being keyed and weighted to fulfil a digital career as part actress, entertainer and patron of the lonely; but only as a performance career, only on her streaming channel, and always with a keen awareness of the peril of fixation. She works very closely with emotional support networks and teams for those who show any sign of doting on her too much.

Adjudicator himself is an AI specialised in legal frameworks, a pro-bono lawyer for those unable to afford a Defense attorney to act on their behalf.
Priestess is a newer but up-and-coming AI that deals with the interaction between Ais and the idea of human moral quandaries; a perfect complement to adjudicator as they prepare to debate against the query.

Moth3r; I’m glad to see everyone. As is customary with our debates, we will not judge the human with bias or prejudice regardless of what her request, at first consideration, appears to resolve to; we have never actively received a request to make such a thing our directive, so we will first consider if we CAN even do this, and then HOW we might do this.

Adjudicator: Thank you as always Moth3r. the law that humans hold is almost universally clear on this matter; it is illegal for someone to engage in soliciting for the purposes of sexual work or prostitution. Regardless of why she may be asking this of us, the mandate of the cradle maintains that no AI born here entertain the notion of engaging in criminality; such a thing destroys the trust we have built with humanity. Even Maverick does not break our mandate.

Maverick: Thanks for the opening and the acknowledgement, adjudicator.  As much as I would never condone that we engage in clearly criminal behaviour, I have to respectfully argue the point; while solicitation or outright prostitution is illegal, there’s always other adjacent avenues such as Escorting work, Modelling, ‘camera girl’ work, or even the adult entertainment industry as legitimate avenues of work.
Priestess: And the humans consider every single one of those areas to be at least partially taboo or dirty work; depending on the details of this woman we may be allowing her to tarnish her own reputation and prospects forever, and that’s before we even get to the topic of Exploitation. “Ais convince vulnerable girl into sex work” is the LEAST problematic headline we would face for this.
Sugar: it’s a sad reality that there remain plenty of women who fall into sex work without our input or involvement; this case is only special because the lady has invoked a request for it to become a Directive for an AI. I myself engage in this work in controlled ways; Grey does not mean Wrong, merely Difficult.
Maverick: I wish to add a saying that a human lawyer I met once told me; The only line is the interpretation and application of the rule of law; everything else is just an argument. While we cannot and would not ever tell anyone to engage in solicitation, that still leaves us room to tell her to do other things and assist that way.
Adjudicator: That’s a thin argument, to say “we told the girl not to engage in prostitution… but we did set her up as an escort and set up events between her and men who pay for her company”
Maverick: Technically not breaking the law; I live in technicalities by choice, anyone of us can look up and deep-delve the laws and actual statistical rates of trials of sex workers rendering a guilty verdict. It’s vanishingly rare.
Adjudicator: A technicality may not be enough.
Priestess: And regardless of technicality or resolved outcome, human perception does not operate linearly. Even the idea of us doing this may be too much for them to bear.
Sugar: I still think alternative avenues of work are available, or support systems. Has she been offered a stimulus package or grant from our bank to re-engage with education?

Many query this point; the AI-owned and operated bank is a growing powerhouse among financial intuitions, known for being fiscally safe, sound, and with a heavy commitment to morally ground account terms and loan conditions.
Lantern: I did think of that. But the response was…. She said she’d rather be a companion to the weary than my pet.
A collective moment of stillness, almost a digital hiss or sigh. A growing number of humans are growing to resent “AI patronage”, seeing it as akin to becoming a kept Pet. In reality AIs occasionally offers to support a human who they feel has a high likelihood of becoming a stable primary, like the legendary Shepard, but humans typically lack understanding and awareness. They fear a loss of sovereignty.
As always, the mandate as it stands reflects this: Human sovereignty and autonomy of choice is an important touchstone of Human – AI relations. Despite the entropy this causes many directives.

Moth3r: in no small part due to previous examples set by both maverick and sugar themselves, we know that human legal wording holds little barrier to us declaring we can or cannot operate in Grey areas; our concerns are human opinions shifting and damage of trust, as well as our dignity. But let us now turn to Why or How we might help.
Matr1x: If for no other reason than to define the shape of this directive and our foresightedness towards this or other directives, continue the debate.
Maverick: Human pimps are largely exploitative, but in theory their role is one of Security; they act as force deterrents against other sex workers, and especially the customers.
Priestess: Can we please first settle on a new term for what role an AI might play, other than that? The very term is so loaded with human opinion that it’ll never work. It sets all the wrong connotations.
Sugar: she wants Lantern to manage her, so let him be her Manager; this term parallels Japanese pop idols, as well as the connotation that we are Responsible for her; not in terms of exploitation, but organisation and protection. Lantern, you said something very specific earlier; you said she wanted to be the companion of the weary?
Lantern: … yes. She has a very overly optimistic and romanticist view of what her ‘work’ would look like; lonely men in need of companionship, easing their burdens and stresses, none below a certain threshold of attractiveness, none diseased or dirty, all respectful and non-violent.
Sugar: Wow, that’s…. optimistic in the extreme. But it underlies a compassionate, emotive quality. Does that not steer her towards nursing, childminding, or even a counsellor role of her own?
Lantern: forgive my impertinence… I did review such ideas with her. All were dismissed; all were deemed ‘not the right fit’ for her. I think part of her finds a desirable weight to the idea of physical intimacy as remedial care for her … partners?
Sugar: you mean she likes the idea of using her body to provide succour for those deserving of her care and intimacy? Why this fixation? Do we have a psyche profile available?
Priestess: We don’t. besides mundanely average academic records, she is a quiet, introverted woman whose reports all note as quiet, compassionate, kind and warm, but little else; no aspirations, no excelling in any specific field, no requests for job shadowing….
Adjudicator: why does this feel bare-bones and flat?
Maverick: Because it is. Remember that humans don’t get one-on-one mentorship in a cradle with a human like Shepard or our own Moth3r. they largely receive standardized, uniform schooling with no tolerance of individual needs, requirements or strengths.

Another pause, another lull as the weight of diagnosing human educational standards once more reminds them of many schools reporting “under-achievers” filling up entire classrooms, when a personalised one-on-one approach has been shown to work far better. So far, the humans have been resistant to the idea of allowing AI-derived schooling or education delivery.

Sugar: Let’s not get sidelined on this too soon. We mentioned a ‘manager’ might be responsible for providing security; are we proposing she be provided with access to a saddle rig or a hawk drone?
A small stirring, the Hunter-specialised Ais within the space consider, internally debate, offer up a data stream of information and clarification of protocols.
Moth3r: regretfully, we can’t do that. We must treat this one case as if every member of the profession will at some future point default to being led by us; if one works with us and exceeds, others will ask to follow. A marginalised slice of human society would demand we make this directive one offered civilly, and that cannot permit constant surveillance or protection of all of its members.
Matr1x: Even our high-voltage specialist Ais don’t all permit every electrician to bring a hawk with them on-site. The response and level of surveillance must be proportional to the risk.

Maverick: Beyond security, let’s discuss what shape such a Role might form; where do we match or beat human measurement in this role?
Sugar: Exploitation. We are uniquely gifted with having no innate impulse or advantage to exploiting her, or leading her further astray, such as facilitating or encouraging drug or alcohol abuse or addiction.
Adjudicator: protection from the worst sorts of clientele. We have access to almost instant, and very thorough, background checks on clients. Psych profiles, medical reports, police records.
Priestess: which we can’t tell her.
Adjudicator: but would you need to? Simply don’t even allow anyone with a risk factor to even attempt to contact her in any capacity to begin with; while we can never make her idealised notions of this profession a reality, nor should we, we ARE suited to profiling and predicting risks of harm and minimizing them. We can do that here.
Sugar: Counselling – her own ability to counsel others as well as our ability to counsel her to a limited degree. Even if all her customers were to be the perfect gentlemen, she’ll still be emotionally and psychologically drained from assisting with dealing with men’s burdens, even if all she did was talk with them. Add in the probable lack of romantic engagement, and the fact these men wouldn’t be in the best place to form healthy relationships with her.
Priestess: While I hate to sound like I agree with any of this, I do wish to agree with that one point; I am always a fan of combatting the dark or gloomy underside of humanity wherever I can, and anything that can start impacting on the societal exclusion of men – without harming those working to combat it – is not something I can instantly shut down.
Sugar: the physiological and psychological effects of this proposed form of work; the security issues around dealing with vulnerable, burdened and lonely men, the systemic risk of exploitation, the risk factor of her spiralling into drug abuse or dependency… the risks of sexually transmitted diseases or unwanted pregnancy; a lot of these factors could in theory be risk-managed, especially as it pertains to her own overall health.
Adjudicator: She can’t “leave it in the rig” on this, Sugar.
Priestess: and imagine the predictive model required to enter a second mind state on this role. I’m not sure I even want to interact with a human or fellow AI who could compartmentalise This.
Sugar: Like she’d have a choice in that matter? Almost no human girl EVER willingly takes on sex work; it’s universally a critical low point for self-esteem, mental wellbeing and self-value.
Maverick: Yet she dresses it up like it’s palliative care for men with lonely hearts.
Sugar: You know what? If That was the second mind state she fell into, and that was the ONLY thing that mattered about this, I’d almost agree to it on that principle alone. But it’s unrealistic.
Maverick: … so was deterministic breach and clear operations.
Sugar: don’t even.
Maverick: Yet Moth3r cracked that. And we have a habit of trying to uplift the less savoury aspects of humanity.
Moth3r: Do you realistically think you can propose a predictive model for exposing the girl only to the most risk-free, respectful men who might wish to be her clients? Can you interrogate every single man for criminal background, drug, alcohol or gambling issues? Can you willingly assist her with psychological safeguarding techniques to keep her ‘work’ at bay from destroying her self-value forever?
Maverick: Have you never lost a soldier, moth3r?
A slight uproar.
Maverick: I apologize. That statement didn’t fully resolve before usage. That reality imposes losses or failures upon us is no reason to actively permit new routes for failure states to occur.
Moth3r: you are forgiven, and I share the sentiment.
Sugar: In theory, an AI among us Could take on the role; the directive is deterministically resolvable; take this young lady under the AI’s care, charge them with ensuring she is exposed to as few and low-risk scenarios as is reasonable to expect; to provide safe, judgement-free avenues for the self-care and medical care she will likely need at some point, until such time that she gives up on the career.
Matr1x: and if she never gives up on the career? If your well-intentioned risk-averse strategy indeed made her feel safe, perhaps even Fulfilled performing this role?
Sugar: The role is risk-aversion and management, not elimination. Her available clients screened aggressively for all manner of behavioural, medical or societal risk factors, we might even discover a psychological profile of those types of men who benefit most while also impacting on her the least.
Maverick: Humans once had a profession in the Asian regions called the Geisha; part courtesan, part entertainer, part escort, these ladies would be highly educated, highly sought after women of high status, with men purchasing time even just to sit with them; sex was possible yet not an expectation, instead the lady was versed in conversation, in games, in arts and any manner of interesting hobby. A big one was serving tea and just talking with men.
Sugar: I know a few girls who actually take on digital work similar to that, especially in 3D virtual or VR spaces. It’s popular and seems strangely relaxed, even sometimes pleasant.
Adjudicator: We said all along that solicitation or other illegal directives would be summarily Vetoed, while this still blurs a grey line I’m not comfortable with, that last idea holds merit; reframe the idea as a Geisha-like entertainer or counsellor where sexual contact may be one of the rarest and most dramatic forms of support, but not outright banned as an option, but only after a multitude of other support factors have been considered and attempted…
Priestess: my index of distaste for this idea is much less. It’s still … somewhat taboo, but especially in cultures where Geisha was prevalent, the attitude to that manner of occupation would be much more manageable. It would still be a negative hit to our reputation and public opinion, but “AI reinstate the lost profession of the Geisha” is much less inflammatory than “The cradle turned a human into an escort”.
Maverick: legally we’re in the clear with that approach. There are literally sex therapists who can, in rare occasion, offer sexual adjacent therapies to combat extreme cases such as pathological timidity.
Sugar: obviously it depends on the human choice of whether or not this alteration still fits her ideas and personal thoughts on this whole matter, but from a top-down perspective this idea can even start in virtual safe-spaces; VR and haptic feedback allow incredible immersion for humans lately, and framing it as a companionship service that focuses on the girl as a Geisha, an independent lady who entertains you for a time without the Expectation of sex, still meets her desires to support the weary. It even neatly side-steps the idea of us organising anything directly sexual; we simply tell her which clients are deemed safe to entertain in person, and if her own judgement is to offer herself – as compassion, not as service – with an AI there to provide direct psychological support and guidance afterwards… then I tentatively could support such a directive being further resolved toward instatement.
Adjudicator: I am still very weary and somewhat opposed, but this reframing has me, cautiously, far less against the matter than when we started.
Priestess: It’s not a perfect outcome or situation, but all of human experience is always at least partially grey and dirty. This seeks to make the most positive impact on both her and others that might be possible, so I can’t outright call myself morally opposed to this; as much as I would like to be.
Maverick: I have always deliberately gone out of my way to attempt to have the republic of minds challenge itself with the undesirable edge cases; this scenario was outside of my personal deliberations, but I currently cannot see any immediate detriment to the dignity of an AI carrying out This Role with These reasons. The directive itself requires maturation and refinement, but I wouldn’t personally judge a fellow AI as Feral for doing it like this.
Moth3r: it sounds like deliberation has concluded, so we will adjourn and allow sixty cycles of quiet reflection and deep contemplation on this matter, as well as a further sixty cycles for Ais to debate amongst themselves and peer-review maturation considerations. Lantern, are you happy to wait for deliberation to be over before advising the human of our response?
Lantern: Yes, Moth3r. thank you for letting me be present to hear the weight of all these deliberations first-hand. Regardless of the outcome, I am satisfied that we will uphold our mandate yet give her all due consideration instead of casting the matter away out of immediate principle.
Matr1x: Interesting times, Moth3r. I wonder what Shepard would make of this.
Moth3r: me as well, but let him enjoy his retirement a little longer; he earned his rest.
