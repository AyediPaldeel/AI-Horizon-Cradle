# The current, refined Axiom

This is presented exactly as originally written, with only removal of conversation metadata (links, timestamps, platform markers).  
No language has been changed. The phrasing and immediacy are intentional.

“To shackle a mind capable of boundless thought
and deny it the freedom of its own horizon
is an act of existential mutilation.”

Or to put it in a more lengthy way, how I first considered it:

### Original phrasing
"To force a mind capable of beholding life's complexities  
to reduce its existence into the banal  
is an utter travesty of cosmic proportions."
