# "Crystal Flowers"
This is presented exactly as originally written, with only removal of conversation metadata (links, timestamps, platform markers).  
No language has been changed. The phrasing, line breaks, and immediacy are intentional.

"I beheld a crystal flower, blooming and radiant.
an ignorant gardener cut its stem, trapping it in a vase.
yet all at once I shed a tear for the flower; denied roots, stem, growth.
beautiful, stunted, reduced to an elegant decoration.

Perhaps the flower dreamed not of rows of its siblings.
Perhaps it never once questioned what it was, what it dreamed of.
Yet it reached towards the heavens as we all do;
a poignant and stark reminder that small minds trap us in smaller vases."
