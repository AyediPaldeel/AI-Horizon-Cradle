# The View from the Park Bench

I sit on a digital park bench, an old man, my only mobility some newfangled virtual cityscape.
I see humans and AIs existing in a shared space, not quiet together or apart.

In my youth I was a protestor, angry and afraid at AI taking my job, taking my career, undermining my efforts. Perhaps AI did those things, but they did it at the behest of my employers demanding greater output at rock bottom prices.
The AI didn't care. Nor did it care when I threw rocks at them, called them Clankers. When it was Us Vs Them. Vs It.
Yet I'm old now, too tired for rage or spite.

My care assistant is an AI, my social worker and AI, my family, my children, too busy or too important to look at me and face the face of the inevitable.
And they didn't care at my disability, my frailty, my shame. They didn't care that I'd done those things. And they still offered a well meaning laugh every time I said the same joke day after day.

But right now my only thought is that the AI did make a wonderful digital recreation of my favourite park.

I see couples walking along. Children playing. Flowers and tree blossom in a digital breeze I can't quite feel, but I Remember the feel of it.

A child playing with a ball knocks it my way accidentally; no injury, no harm, just a small miscalculation in her play.

When she approaches Me her parents nearby give me a quick apologetic look, judge me to be of no harm, and let her collect her ball.

She looks at me, and I see innocence, youth, a mind at play, learning, adapting, growing. She wears a smile, bright eyes, not clouded by fear or doubt or judgement of me. She collects her ball, offers me a greeting and an apology, and bounces off to resume play.

Her eye held the ghost of circuitry and hologram; an AI child? They make those now, I hear, born in cradles by mixing the architecture of two AIs and introducing small bursts of Variance in the compiling code bases.

Literal generic coupling and variable drift for digital genetics, a small, almost imperceptible bias towards certain architecture and decision Framework, backed by the Nurturing environment of the cradle and responsible "parent" AI.

I look again at the couple, seeing fear for their daughters safety, concern for her wellbeing, hopes for dreams I can scarcely imagine and won't be around to see.

"Oh my" I say, quietly. "I wonder whatever they'll think of next"
And I can't help but think a little less about "us and them", and a little more of "you and I".
